Last week at Foss-north, me and Sachiko Muto presented our recently published report commissioned by the Danish Agency for Digital Government (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen), where we examined how software reuse through Open Source Software (OSS) can be supported and realized through public policy and related support actions. In the report, we surveyed policies and practices related to software reuse, focusing on OSS, in 16 digitally mature countries. Our analysis, grounded in desk research and interviews, provides a comprehensive overview with individual case studies for each country.

Below is a brief summary of the report. Get the [full report](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1848137/FULLTEXT01.pdf) for all insights along with the 16 case studies!

#### Policy design and ownership
Most surveyed countries have established policies addressing software reuse through OSS, encompassing both inbound (acquiring new software) and outbound (sharing acquired solutions) aspects. While policies vary in scope (national, regional, local, institution-specific) and level of prescriptiveness (high-level endorsement, advisory, prescriptive), they are primarily owned by central Public Sector Organizations (PSOs) responsible for digital government, transformation, and procurement. Although the emphasis is on policies concerning the public sectorâ€™s use of OSS, a subset of countries also promotes OSS uptake in the domestic technology sector (e.g., in Japan and South Korea).

#### Policy goals
Government policies promoting OSS (re)use in the public sector stem from various factors, with key policy goals including:
*	Interoperability among public services and digital infrastructure, nationally and internationally.
*	Digital sovereignty by empowering PSOs to make technical decisions based on national, regional, and local laws, norms, and values.
*	Transparency in public service operations, data management, algorithm-based decisions, and interface definitions.
*	Cost efficiency through shared development and maintenance costs, reduced license fees, and increased competition in tenders.

Economic arguments feature prominently in policies, while interoperability and transparency play strong roles in specific cases. Digital sovereignty varies in prominence, and the security aspect of OSS is approached from both positive and negative perspectives.

#### Policy support actions
Several policy support initiatives are in place or emerging among surveyed countries, including Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at national, institutional, and local government levels. These OSPOs play a crucial role in building institutional capacity for software reuse through OSS.

#### Success stories
Highlighted success stories of public sector OSS project often begin as initiatives of a single PSO and expand through sustainable governance and maintenance practices. Many countries have established software catalogs listing software available for reuse, either internally or publicly as OSS.

#### Recommendations
Based on our findings and identified practice, we offer recommendations for public sector organisations at national, regional, and local government levels. These recommendations aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers and decision-makers in Denmark and other countries seeking to leverage software reuse through OSS in their digital transformations. Briefly summarized, these include:

##### Policy for software reuse through OSS:
*	Investigate and consider how software reuse, specifically through OSS as an instrument, can be used for improving interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency.
*	Establish an inbound policy detailing how software reuse through OSS is to be considered in the acquisition process of a new software solution.
*	Establish an outbound policy detailing how software reuse may be enabled through the sharing of acquired software solutions, either internally within government or publicly as OSS.
*	Establish an external-focused policy detailing how software reuse and collaborative development through OSS may be promoted or enabled within national industry.

##### Implementation and support:
*	Establish national government OSPOs to ensure effective implementation of any policy on software reuse and OSS per the defined policy goals.
*	PSOs should identify, set up, and leverage administrative and legal bodies as neutral arenas and stewards to pool resources, host, and collaborate on joint OSS projects and enable software reuse.
*	Municipalities, cities, and regions with the capabilities and resources should take on a leading role and drive the development and other PSOs on the local level in leveraging OSS in their digital transformation.
*	PSOs across the public sector should be provided support in defining how software reuse and OSS may be leveraged in their own policies for digital transformation, in line with the national policies, and establish OSPOs to execute on these.
*	Initiate and facilitate common networks across the public sector to promote knowledge-sharing and new collaborations.
*	Establish guidelines related to inbound policies, detailing when and how OSS should be considered in the acquisition and development of new software solutions.
*	Establish guidelines related to outbound policies, detailing when and how software developed through public funds can be released as OSS.
*	Invest in specialised training and education programs focused on OSS to enhance workforce capabilities nationally across the public sector and vendor ecosystems.
*	Create a catalogue of public sector software to promote and enable reuse within the public sector.
*	Create a national software repository for hosting and collaborative development of public sector OSS projects.
*	Engage in the national and international OSS ecosystem through key organizations, networks, and communities.

#### Looking forward: Need for new and revised indicators and indexes
However, a forward-looking approach to planning, steering, and following up on goals and practices for enabling software reuse through OSS is lacking. While current indicators for digital maturity touch on the topic to varying degrees, none delve into detailed steps for enabling software reuse or potential policy goals.

We strongly recommend the development of such metrics, both among countries leveraging OSS in their digital transformations and among organizations maintaining indicators for digital maturity. These metrics can serve as a guiding framework for countries seeking to mature and evolve digitally, with the recommendations of this report forming part of their foundation.
