My research commonly touches on the human and social aspects of software engineering, as the development of open technologies by design is a collaborative and social effort. This implies several challenges from a socio-technical perspective, often requiring a qualitative or mixed-method approach to investigate. My goal, however, goes beyond problem understanding, and is focused on developing knowledge and designing artifacts that can help to address the problem at hand in a real-world context. An iterative process I prefer to do in collaboration with the actors present in the problem context.
<p /><p>

Areas I'm currently investigating include:
<ul>
<li>how public sector can use, develop, and collaborate on Open Source Software in a sustainable manner.</li>
<li>how public and private actors can share and collaborate on (open) data and related boundary resources in the context Open Data Ecosystems.</li>
<li>how public and private actors can analyze the health of an Open Source Software project, and thereby make appropriate sourcing decision or proactive health measures.</li>
<li>how and when open technologies can considered as digital commons, and how their sustainability may be informed by theory of the commons.</li>
<li>how public actors can apply and collaborate on procurement activities to enable an open and agile development of systems and software.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research projects</h3>

<h5>Governance in an Open Government Data Ecosystem for skills provisioning and lifelong learning</h5>
<ul>
  <li>2022-03 to 2023-01 | SEK 500,000</li>
  <li>Funded by Swedish Public Employment Service (Stockholm, SE)</li>
  <li>Support for the Swedish Public Employment Service and multiple other national agencies in the government assignment on developing a cohesive data infrastructure for skills supply and lifelong learning.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Health and Security Management for Open Source Software</h5>
<ul>
  <li>2021-08 to 2023-08 | SEK 3,890,000</li>
  <li>VINNOVA (Stockholm, SE)</li>
  <li>Develop a support for Swedish industry to analyze the health of critical Open Source Software projects, and guidelines for how to improve the health and mitigate risks of vulnerabilites being introduced.</li>
</ul>

<h5>JobTech Dev Research Project â€“ Collaboration and Governance in Open Government Data Ecosystems</h5>
<ul>
  <li>2019-10 to 2021-12 | SEK 3,419,350</li>
  <li>Funded by Swedish Public Employment Service (Stockholm, SE)</li>
  <li>A two-year research project focused on supporting of SPES and the realization of their JobTech Dev Open (Government) Data ecosystem and thereby SPES's move from the role of being a service provider to becoming a service enabler. The JobTech Dev ecosystem consists of third-party organizations and private citizens with the common vision to enable new and improved digital match-making and guidance services based on the data, as well as boundary resources (e.g., OSS, API:s and standards), shared and co-created within the ecosystem. Beyond contributing to a successful realization of the JobTech Dev ecosystem, the research project aimed to create a blueprint for how software organizations similar to SPES within the public sector can undergo a similar transformation by opening up using the data ecosystem model.</li>
