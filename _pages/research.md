My research commonly touches on the human and social aspects of software engineering, as the development of open technologies by design is a collaborative and social effort. This implies several challenges from a socio-technical perspective, often requiring a qualitative or mixed-method approach to investigate. My goal, however, goes beyond problem understanding, and is focused on developing knowledge and designing artifacts that can help to address the problem at hand in a real-world context. An iterative process I prefer to do in collaboration with the actors present in the problem context.

Areas I'm currently investigating include:
<ul>
<li>how public sector can use, develop, and collaborate on Open Source Software in a sustainable manner.</li>
<li>how public and private actors can share and collaborate on (open) data and related boundary resources in the context Open Data Ecosystems.</li>
<li>how public and private actors can analyze the health of an Open Source Software project, and thereby make appropriate sourcing decision or proactive health measures.</li>
<li>how and when open technologies can considered as digital commons, and how their sustainability may be informed by theory of the commons.</li>
<li>how public actors can apply and collaborate on procurement activities to enable an open and agile development of systems and software.</li>
</ul>
