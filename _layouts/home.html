 Hi there! I'm a Senior Researcher at <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/person/johan-linaker" target="_top">RISE Research Institutes of Sweden</a> and <a href="https://lu.se" target="_top">Lund University</a> living in Malm√∂, Sweden. This website provides my effort in promoting open science through the sharing of talks, publications, and writings I've done through the years :)
<p />

<h2>Recent blog posts</h2>

<i>Everything from notes and thoughts, to summaries of talks, papers and reports. Some in English, some in Swedish pending the context :)</i>
